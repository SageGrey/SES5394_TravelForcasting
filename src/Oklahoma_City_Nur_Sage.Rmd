# **Overview** 
## Oklahoma City at a Glance

Oklahoma City is the capital of Oklahoma and the largest city in the state. At the 2020 Census, the OKC Metro area had a population just shy of 1.5 million people (Census, 2020). In the 2021 American Community Survey (ACS), 62% of respondents reported their race as white, 10% African American, 8% Multiracial, 3% Native American, 3% Asian, 1% other (ACS 2018). 14% reported identifying as Hispanic (ACS 2018). Some well-known neighborhoods in OKC include Downtown, Bricktown (entertainment district), Deep Deuce (residential, formerly an African American neighborhood), The Arts District, Film Row, Midtown, Automobile Alley, Plaza District, Cottage District, Uptown, Asian District, Paseo Arts District, Crown-Heights-Edgemere Heights, Western Avenue Corridor, and 39th Street Enclave. Three major interstates--I-35, I-40, and I-44 all pass through OKC. 



### Transit Analysis Zones
Our transportation analysis looks at 419 transis analysis zones across 7 counties. 

### OKC Road Network 

The longest distance between zones by car was just over 3 hours and 15 minutes (190.5 minutes). The shortest distance was half a minute (0.5 minutes). The average distance between TAZ centroids is roughly 30 minutes (30.7), the median time is around 25 minutes (25.6 minutes).

### OKC Public Transit Network
The OKC Transit network is composed of 651 miles of bus routes, across 30 different bus lines. The map below shows the bus network in detail, and in the context of the whole city. Of our 419 transit analysis zones for OKC metro area, the transit network connects only 135 of those zones, with the longest travel time between zones being just over 3 hours and 15 minutes (190.5 minutes). The shortest distance was half a minute (0.5 minutes). The average distance between centroids is roughly 30 minutes (30.7). The median time between centroids was around 25 minutes (25.6 minutes). The public transit is fully contained in 3 of the 7 counties that make up the OKC statistical area.

# **Definitions, Methodology & Sources**

### Definitions

**Accessibility** is a measure of what destination travelers can reach using transportation modes available to them. Accessibility = mobility x proximity. 


### Methodology + Sources

#### Data About Oklahoma City Demographics and Land Use 
For data about the population density, income, household size, and vehicle availability of we used 5-year Sample American Community Survey (ACS) Data from 2021. For information about the land use and employment we used Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD). For geographic boundaries we used census data.  


#### Road Network
To generate the Road Network we used data pulled from **Open Street Map**, downloaded through the service **https://extract.bbbike.org/.** We included in our road network all road segments labeled as motorways, motorway_links, secondary, tertiary,  trunks or unclassified roads. We decided to include the unclassified roads when we realized that major roads including US-77, US-62 were not included in motorways. Adding in unclassified roads also brought back in “boulevards,” such as Oklahoma City Boulevard and North Lincoln Boulevard. Our assumption is that since the original data did not label any roads as “primary,” many roads that would have been considered primary were instead labeled as unclassified.We then began to generate a transit skim using the software **Transcad.**

#### Public Transportation Network
In this model we used General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data pulled from Oklahoma City [EMBARK's GTFS feed](https://embarkok.com/data/gtfs/google_transit.zip).


### Assumptions 

#### Assumptions for Road Network
1. All primary and secondary roads in rural areas are two-way roads even if coded as one-way roads in the OSM data. This assumption was based on cross-referencing against satellite images that indicated roads had bi-directional traffic despite being coded as one-ways in OSM. We identified rural areas by looking at the network and selecting areas that had large, mostly rectangular Transit Area Zones (TAZs). See image for an image of primary or secondary road segments that we treated as rural. 

2. We made the following speed assumptions: 
* Unclassified road speeds are 30 mph
* Motorways are 60 mph
* Primary are 60 mph
* Secondary are 40 mph
* Tertiary are 30 mph
* Centroid Connectors are 15.

3. In our model we assumed that centroid connectors could model residential roads in each TAZ. In our model, centroid connectors can be up to 25 miles long, but must connect to a road no more than .1 miles outside of the zone boundary. Each centroid could have up to 7 centroid connectors. 

#### Assumptions for Transit Network

1. The maximum initial wait time for a public transit trip was 15 minutes.
2. The walk speed for a traveler is 2.8 miles per hour.
3. Buses move at 30 miles per hour.
4. Centroid connectors could be a maximum of 0.5 miles long.

#### Assumptions for Accessibility Metrics
1. We are weighting the portion of time spent waiting for a bus or train as 2.5 times the in-vehicle travel time (IVTT)

2. We are using a logistic decay function with an inflection of 25 and standard deviation of 5
